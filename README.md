The workforce is evolving, and Gen Z is at the forefront of change! 🌍 Their expectations from employers, managers, and career growth opportunities differ drastically from previous generations. How can businesses adapt?

I’ve built an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze Gen Z’s career preferences, salary expectations, managerial aspirations, and work culture preferences. The insights are eye-opening! Let’s dive in! 🔍👇  

📌 𝗠𝗶𝘀𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗔𝘀𝗽𝗶𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀 𝗼𝗳 𝗚𝗲𝗻 𝗭

✅ 72% of Gen Z say NO! They are unwilling to work for a company with a misaligned mission.  
✅ Only 27.7% of Gen Z would accept a job without a strong company vision.

✅ Only 53 Gen Z employees are okay with managers setting unrealistic targets.  
✅ They value support, growth, and clear expectations over micro-management.

📌 2268 employees are willing to stay with an employer for 3+ years if they feel valued.
